[Agent Based Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-based_model)
An agent-based model (ABM) is a class of computational models for simulating the actions and interactions of autonomous
agents (both individual or collective entities such as organizations or groups) with a view to assessing their effects on
the system as a whole.
