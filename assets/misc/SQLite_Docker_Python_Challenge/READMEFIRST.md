# This is my summary for this data Challenge

### I will have to say that I don't have much time at this exact moment otherwise I would have it all figured out

## But here's what I have achieved:

### Set up webservice (webservice2.py) that can be used to track the intern applications which is stored in SQLite database (in this case i have set up SQLite database as well)

### Wrote a function specifically for bulkily importing interns (in webservice2.py, named create_interns_api)

### Set up unit test for each function I wrote and tested that they run correctly (check out test.py)


### Wrote the manual.md file to explain how specifically the user should enter data, or create table or drop table

### Set up docker in the dockerize file

### Set up webpage templates

### write comments for the code so that the reader knows what this function does, what the parameters are and what the output/return value is



## Here's what I planned to achieve but did not finish because I am short of time:

### Setting up webpages for showing the values in the database tables and inserting new values to the database through the webpage

### I actually took a class that exposed me a little to Flask/Sqlite two years ago, so I was trying to brush up my knowledge and duplicate the contents that I was taught, but I spent hours on it only to find out that the rules probably has changed (check out data.sqlite and webservice.py). My initial plan was to do it in two ways, but i only completed one.

### I have not had time to sort out the logic to connect the database and app so that the values in the database can be shown on the webpage but if I have more time I'll do it.
