How to grade lab 4:

Download "test.m" and each student's files in a separate directory, and then run the script "test.m" to run all at once.

1) Each problem is worth 10pts.

2) -2 points for each file uploaded to Sakai is not named as specified on the lab 4 document.

3) For problem 1-2, check the student's script files and verify the validity of the commands.
Run the script files and check that the output matches the vectors/matrices that are asked.

4) For problem 3, check the student's script file and verify the validity of the commands.
Verify the inverse array against the answer provided and the last command printed the identify matrix.
If inv() is used, no points!

5) For problem 4-6, 
a) 70% for correctness and 30% for docs.
b) -2 points for incorrect function name.
c) -2 points for incorrect parameter(s).
d) for problem 4, if a loop is used, no points (or partial points based on your judgement).

Problem 4:
run seqSum(1,5) and verify that the answer is 2.2833.
run seqSum(2,5) and verify that the answer is 4.5667.

Problem 5:
run smallerThanN([1 2 3 4 5], 3) and verify that the answer is [1 2]
run smallerThanN([10 5 2 1 7], 3) and verify that the answer is [2 1]

Problem 6:
run narcissisticNumbers() and verify that the numbers it returned are 370 and 371.


6) For problem 7-8, 
a) check the student's script files and verify the validity of the commands
b) visually verify that the graph appears correct.
