# HOMEWORK 1

## Due October 1

Hurricane Zaphod is barreling down the South Atlantic towards Florida, currently rated at Category 3. Sustained winds are in the 111-129mph range, normally distributed. It may weaken to a Category 2, or strengthen to Category 4 or even 5, we don't know. 

We know that building codes in West Palm Beach mandate wind reistance up to 160 mph for commercially zoned buildings, 120 mph for residential, and 90 mph for mobile homes. 

When a building fails, it fails catastrophically, sending debris in the air. Bigger commercial buildings send more debris then small ones. A commercial building can withstand 1000 debris hits before failing, a residential building 500, and a mobile home 1. West Palm Beach has 100,000 buildings, with 20% commercial, 70% residential and 10% mobile homes. 

(note: I pulled numbers out of thin air -- if you find actual data, please update!). 

(note2: I'm deliberately disregarding wind direction and geospatial aspects -- that's too complex to deal with for now. For purposes of this model, all buildings are within striking distance of each other)

You are a FEMA admin charged with estimating hurricane damage, as it makes direct landfall on West Palm Beach. 

(1) Think about model boundaries, units of analysis and time. What am I missing here? Too much detail vs. not enough? 
(note: I deliberately missed a few things. This is a good reflection of what you experience with real clients)

(2) Build a stocks-and-flows diagram for a direct hurricane hit -- think about hurricane approach, eye-wall, eye, and dissipation/departure

(3) Write out equations that connect stocks, flows and variables

(3) Using MicroSD, VennSim, InsightMaker, NetLogo or any other tool of your choice, try to build this model and estimate hurricane damage based on speed at landfall. 

(4) Run some experiments with this model -- enhance the building codes, get rid of trailer parkes, etc. Use a good experimental design technique. Describe your reasoning for experimental design

(5) Bonus question: Mar-a-Lago is a sturdy commercial building. What is the probability that Hurricane Zaphod destroys it?

## Grading: Valiant effort. 

Please attempt EVERY question. If you get stuck, talk to folks on Slack or talk to me. If you get REALLY REALLY stuck, describe in detail WHY you're stuck. 

Legitimate reasons for stuckness: 

#1 problem is badly specified -- this is given. Redefine the problem as you see fit, describe your reasoning and sally forth 

#2 model does not converge and I can't make it converge 

#3 Max, you're full of it. I agree, I'm full of it. ;-)
